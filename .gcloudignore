# Cloud Build ignore file
# This controls what gets uploaded to Cloud Build via `gcloud builds submit`

# Include everything needed for Docker build
# (Docker build then uses .dockerignore to filter further)

# Dependencies (installed fresh in build)
node_modules/

# Build output (built fresh)
dist/

# Git
.git/
.gitignore

# IDE
.vscode/
.idea/
*.swp
*.swo

# OS
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db

# Logs
logs/
*.log

# Test files (not needed for production build)
tests/
coverage/
playwright-report/
test-results/
vitest.config.ts

# Temporary files

*.tmp

# Downloaded Excel files
*.xlsx
*.xls

# IMPORTANT: Do NOT exclude these (needed for build):
# - src/              (TypeScript source)
# - data/seed-data.json (seed data for Firestore bootstrap - speeds up cold start)
# - package.json      (dependencies)
# - Dockerfile        (build instructions)
# - tsconfig.json     (TypeScript config)

# Note: data/seed-data.json is in .gitignore (not committed to git)
# but deliberately NOT in .gcloudignore (uploaded to Cloud Build)
# This allows fast Firestore bootstrap without syncing from Alko.fi on first request
